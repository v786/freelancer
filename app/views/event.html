          <h4><strong>An inclusive society is a healthy society….</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Integration of Autistic Children into mainstream makes not only these children feel part of society, but also allows for overall growth of us as individuals. Autistic children are different & talented, however, have difficulties in communication. With therapy and integration, these communication gaps reduce as they learn to be part of the society at large. Therefore, Integrate us.
